Banano Miner Watch is a **Chrome Browser Extension** that gives you the amount that came from home@folding and WorkUnits that you worked there in a easy way!


# How to install?

Because of the fee's creation for Chrome Developer Account ($5), i don't have that much because of my country fiat money, to upload the zip folder I just put the code here to everyone that wants to use! If you want to improve and modify, be free to do! :)

*TL;DR Enable developer mode in Chrome Browser -> unzip this package then you'll choose him in the load unpackaged in your chrome browser (can be brave browser too!)*

## Step 1 Download from github
 Download the latest release from [tags in the github](https://github.com/andrecrjr/bananominer-watch/releases) (Download ZIP then you can unzip the folder)

## Step 2 Enable Developer Mode in Chrome
Go to [chrome extensions](chrome://extensions) can be using [Brave Browser](brave://extensions) for example! then you'll need to turn on the Developer Mode in the top left corner from Chrome! 
## Step 3 Unzip the package downloaded
Then after you downloaded you'll need to unzip the package downloaded from here and it'll give you the main folder!
## Step 4 Load the package downloaded in the Chrome
So now if you had enabled the developer mode you can put our extension, that's pretty easy, you go to **load unpackaged** > select our folder unziped and done

## After install - Last part
Now it's easy, you get your user id from banano miner and put there! Then will show your informations and the amount you achieved in the miner and all workunits you had worked! if you need to update, just click update!
